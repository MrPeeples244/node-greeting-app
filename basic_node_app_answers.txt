1. What is a Node module?

A: A Node module is a set of functions that you can include in an application. You can import pre-existing
   modules and you can create you own custom modules. Each module is task-specific and they function in much
   the same way as a JavaScript library.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

A: module.exports is the variable returned from require(). It is empty by default and can be reassigned however
   is needed. exports is simply a reference to module.exports. If you try to reassign exports those assignments
   will not be available outside of that specific module. Also, exports is not returned by require() while module.exports
   is.

3. Why is using exports recommended?

A: Using exports is recommended unless you need the module to be a specific object type because it will allow using
   different data types.
